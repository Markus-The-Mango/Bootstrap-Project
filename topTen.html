          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-3">
              <h4>#1 VelociCoaster</h4>
              <p>When in line for this ride I didn't think it could possibly impress me as much as it did. but the sharp turns, low to the ground elements, and amazing theming where enough to get me.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3">
              <h4>#2 magnum xl-200</h4>
              <p>Maybe its the short lines, amazing view, or the amazing elements like the triangle hills or pretzle. but this ride holds a special place in my heart.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3">
              <h4>#3 Raptor</h4>
              <p>I lvoe this classic B&M, the ride is smooth but still jolts you around as it traverses its complex layout, every time I ride I have an amazing experience.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3">
              <h4>#4 The Beast</h4>
              <p>Though it's rough, this ride is perfectly fun to ride and going through the natural landscape makes it such an enjoyable experience. In the end this ride really is a beast.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-3">
              <h4>#5 Forest flyer</h4>
              <p>Theirs a lot to say for adventure and risk, which is what you get on mountain coasters such as forest flyer where you take the ride at your own speed with little interference. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3">
              <h4>#6 Backlot Stunt</h4>
              <p>This ride is very over looked by many but once on you experience an overall great ride with an insane vertical corkscrew and a great fire element that really makes you feel the heat.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3">
              <h4>#7 Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure</h4>
              <p>I wouldn't consider myself a Harry potter fan but this was an amazing experience, the theming was on point and the motercycle cars were fun. plus the many tricks the layout plays are overall amazing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3">
              <h4>#8 great pumpkin coaster</h4>
              <p>This is a very small ride that I only added becuase of its amazing team that put up with my friend and I riding it over and over again and fake screaming on the tiny hill. </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <h4>#9 Steel Vengance</h4>
              <p>While this ride is often a little over rated in my opinion it is still a nice ride. The structure is glorious and makes you feel small as you walk past and the loud lift chain just furthers the clasic coaster experience.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <h4>#10 Sea Dragon</h4>
              <p>Though this ride is fairly simple and overs very little in theming or elements, the historic ride still deserves a mention since it is one of few tradional manual operated rides and really stood to the time.  </p>
